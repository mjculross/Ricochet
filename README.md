Ricochet: a very simplistic watchface without being boring
          (an extension of my ScrSaver app/watchface)

Time & day/date float around the screen (a la Roomba style)
   in a semi-random fashion, "bouncing" off the edges of the
   screen & "ricocheting" off of each other. 

NOTE: to allow full use of the buttons, ScrSaver
   loads in as an app (at the same menu level
   as "Settings" on the Pebble), not as a
   watchface . . . it just displays a watchface

Features (v 1.0):
- selectable black-on-white (default) or
  white-on-black display
- selectable date-on_top display mode (default)
  & time-on-top display mode
- selectable 12/24 hour format time (defaults to
  using current Pebble Settings)
- selectable mm/dd/yy (default) & dd/mm/yy date
  format

Operating instructions:
- to toggle between black-on-white & white-on-black
  displays, long-press the "select" button
- to toggle between date-on-top display mode &
  time-on-top display mode, press the "select"
  button (also freezes the display for 5-seconds)
- to toggle between 12/24 hour format time, press
  the "down" button
- to toggle between mm/dd/yy & dd/mm/yy date
  format, press the "up" button
