ScrSaver: a very simplistic watchface without being boring

Time & day/date float around the screen (a la Roomba style)
   in a semi-random fashion, "bouncing" off the edges of the
   screen. 

NOTE: to allow full use of the buttons, ScrSaver
   loads in as an app (at the same menu level
   as "Settings" on the Pebble), not as a
   watchface . . . it just displays a watchface

Features (v 1.2):
- selectable black-on-white (default) or
  white-on-black display
- selectable time-overwrites-date display mode
  (default) & date-overwrites-time display mode
- selectable 12/24 hour format time (defaults to
  using current Pebble Settings)
- selectable mm/dd/yy (default) & dd/mm/yy date
  format
- freeze mode (time stops moving for 5-seconds)

Operating instructions:
- to toggle between black-on-white & white-on-black
  displays, long-press the "select" button
- to toggle between time-overwrites-date display
  mode & date-overwrites-time display mode, press
  the "select" button (also activates freeze mode)
- to toggle between 12/24 hour format time, press
  the "down" button
- to toggle between mm/dd/yy & dd/mm/yy date
  format, press the "up" button
