ScrSaver: a very simplistic watchface without being boring

Time & day/date float around the screen (a la Roomba style)
   in a semi-random fashion, "bouncing" off the edges of the
   screen. 

NOTE: to allow full use of the buttons, ScrSaver
   loads in as an app (at the same menu level
   as "Settings" on the Pebble), not as a
   watchface . . . it just displays a watchface

Features (v 1.1):
- selectable black-on-white (default) or
  white-on-black display
- selectable time-overwrites-date display mode
  (default) & date-overwrites-time display mode
- displays 12/24 hour format time (using current
  Pebble Settings)

Operating instructions:
- to toggle between black-on-white & white-on-black
  displays, long-press the "select" button
- to toggle between time-overwrites-date display
  mode & date-overwrites-time display mode, press
  the "select" button
